<p>
        This calculator was inspired by the user stories defined in
        <a href="https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Calculator-App.md">
          this repo
        </a>
        but was coded by David RÃ¶nnlid with no further instructions from
        external parties (except Google, StackOverflow, etc.) regarding how to
        develop it.
      </p>

<p>It was a conscious decision to let some bugs remain in this calculator, such as the invalid results returned when users use several arithmetic operators at once before clicking "=". My reasoning behind it is that sometimes limiting project scope saves time and enables focus on what's most important for end users. In the case of this calculator, I simply wanted to move on to other projects after all the user stories outlined in the repo linked to abvoe had been fulfilled.</p> 

<h1>What I learned from developing this calculator</h1>
