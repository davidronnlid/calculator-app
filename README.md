<p>
        This calculator was inspired by the user stories defined in
        <a href="https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Calculator-App.md">
          this repo
        </a>
        but was coded by David RÃ¶nnlid with no further instructions from
        external parties (except Google, StackOverflow, etc.) regarding how to
        develop it.
      </p>

<p>It is a conscious decision to let some bugs remain in this calculator, such as the invalid results returned when users use several arithmetic operators at once before clicking "=". The reason for this is that project scope limitation saves precious time and enables focus on what's most important for end users.</p>
